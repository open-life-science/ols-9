### Reflection exercise: silent note taking

**Self reflection *- No need to share if would like to keep your notes private***

   * Tell us how this video made you feel? You can leave notes below for others if you'd like to share - note that you can keep your notes anonymous by not adding your name:
       *  It reminded me how hard it was for me to take that action
       *  I felt thankful for being reminded as I have not taken that action in a long time
       * Interesting to think about
       * The concepts discussed within the video are new and complex, but he successfully explained them clearly
       * It raises awareness for me.
       * 
       * 
       * Checking in every day to see what my capacity for the day is--sleep, rest, food, emotion, healthetc--to fuel or support resiliency/well being
       *

### **Group reflection:**

   ** *What does “good” self care mean?  ***

   1.   Taking care of your body (eat good, exercise often, give hugs), mind (separate work from family life, talk about your problems but don't focus all the time on them) and spirit (connect with God - he knows everything).   
  2. 

  Faisal: You feel balanced and energized most of the time. You can manage stress effectively.

3. Taking guilt free breaks. Spending time meditating at the end of each day.

4. Staying in touch with my routine--getting regular sleep, eating regularly, regular exercise, having a wind down routine



 ***   What does “bad” self care mean? ***

    1. I think bad self care means that it might lead to bad habits - which will require further self care actions

    2. Say yes to everything, so you don´t have time to do what you like. Taking too many responsibilities.

    3. Perhaps being too hard on yourself with taking care of your body (insisting on exercising when tired, focusing too much on clean eating and not indulging)

    4. Using stress and adrenaline to push through

Bad self-care, when you notice increased feelings of guilt, shame, or avoidance. It hinders your ability to fulfill responsibilities or maintain healthy relationships.





Breakout rooms:

   *  What are the background assumptions, "taken for granted" beliefs and ideas and/or social /cultural discourses  that make those ideas about good and bad self-care possible?   


Share the notes

Room 1:

   *     


Room 2:

   *     The concept of being busy, or being seen as busy, so it puts pressure into making sure you're always seen working, and not taking any rest. Taking unhealthy validation from always working.
   * Thinking it is selfish to take care of yourself, and not realising how damaging it can get when you constantly neglect yourself.


Room 6:

   * I think isolation as a bad thing is an idea that tends to make us think that it's a bad self care habit, but I feel like this has changed recently as we are hyperconnected all the time. I think people felt hyperconnected even when airplanes were invented, and so there were always people wanting to isolate, but maybe today this is potentialized by our current technological arsenal and more people feel like isolating is a good thing for them. I think isolation can be harmful sometimes, but moments of isolation can be great. (+1 from me, because that is how I am able to breathe sometimes.)
   * I think one idea that contributes to “bad” self-care is the focus on performance/achievements. That everything you do should be productive. For example, if you make crafts for fun, people will encourage you to sell them for money. If you like running, you should sign up for races. Set a new personal record. Run marathons. My sister liked playing the drums, so my father entered her into a national drumming contest (against her will). She couldn’t stand the pressure and stopped playing entirely. My partner often wonders why I would make something instead of just buying it and having more time left for work. Because it's fun!
       * That's such a clever idea!


Room 7:

    - it is a cultural thing: maybe if you don't do something you are not strong enough, or responsible...
    - maybe you think other people can not do things like you want them to be done
    -
