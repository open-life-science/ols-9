------------------------------------

## ⌛ Break: 10 mins [⏰ 60 - 70]

### 🏗️ Self reflection and documentation
**Activity: **(20 mins mins for report out and Q\&A) [⏰ 90]



**Create a first draft of open canvas for your project: **
   * Copy template to create a personal copy: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/1/d/1l0XShyo\_FjXIah3hr95QpOHCDlJKpXDp/copy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/1/d/1l0XShyo\_FjXIah3hr95QpOHCDlJKpXDp/copy)
   * There is an example and instruction for how to create open canvas.


### Share out
 (5 mins)  [⏰ 95]
   * **Notes from share out from the breakout discussion**
       * You can fill in your open canva on the language that you're most comfortable with - no need to write on it in English!
       * The Canvas has helped people to think more clearly on their projects
       * You can revisit your canvas as you go, and you can have different versions each time you modify it
       * We often realize that the original scope of our project is too broad, and we missed a step before what we thought would be the main goal. It's ok to reshape your project after going through the open canvas!
       * The key metrics can be a challenge to define, as they are very tightly related to your definition of success. Make sure to discuss that with your mentors

   * Slides: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRME4NPdc7Tx528-p3Veo8wN5galMpVK0PhY7v4IpHXbBQQFmBpyjmSMOoXwAqr5Fyo27mbzC2IaTQL/pub](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRME4NPdc7Tx528-p3Veo8wN5galMpVK0PhY7v4IpHXbBQQFmBpyjmSMOoXwAqr5Fyo27mbzC2IaTQL/pub)


Questions
   *  How are roadmaps related to vision statements?
       * Vision is different from goals - the vision shouldn't change (it's the overall arching goal for your project as a whole), but the goals can be different for different timeframes and related to projects within a big project.
       * "If you weren't here, what would've happen?" - helps to understand the difference you want to make on your community
   * You decide where you want to store your roadmap: it can be on a website, on GitHub or Google Docs.


## 👥 Discuss roadmapping ideas for your project 👥
Malvika Introduces the activity (10 mins) [⏰ 160]


### Instructions for the room:

   * Based on your vision and goalsetting, what are some  short-term goals?
   * How would you know that you are making a progress towards your goals? What are some milestones?
