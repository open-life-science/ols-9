### Share out
 (5 mins) [‚è∞ 30]

   * **Notes from share out from the breakout discussion**
       * Sharepoint can be a good option when you can't share information publicly
       * Wikis are great for documenting project as well! GitHub has its own wiki structure, and you can also use Alliance's wiki [https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Technical\_documentation](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Technical\_documentation)
       * What if people scoop my idea? What's a good amount of sharing to keep your project from being scooped?
           * Sharing does not make ideas stealable - you're the most valuable thing in your project! You execute your project in a unique way that nobody can copy.
           * You need to make a decision about why something can or cannot be shared.

## üñ• Open Licensing!

Malvika (15 min + 5 mins Q\&A)[‚è∞ 115]

   * Slides: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTf33DwDYvqW7Ln-kbRgs5ofQTek6yNlvHHbLWmnj3Oy7Bc6uY2dOWmPrRVLW9KKw/pub?start=false\&loop=false\&delayms=3000](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTf33DwDYvqW7Ln-kbRgs5ofQTek6yNlvHHbLWmnj3Oy7Bc6uY2dOWmPrRVLW9KKw/pub?start=false\&loop=false\&delayms=3000)


Notes:
   * Open licenses are important documents that set ground rules about re-use, re-mix and distribution of your work.
   * Three aspects of open licenses:
       * use
       * modify
       * share
       * ‚ö†Ô∏è Attribution, commercialization, remix, and derivative license
   * Licenses can range from proprietary (least permissive) to public domain (most permissive).
   * Putting things online don't make them open, but adding documents about why they are open (README) and how they are open (LICENSE), do!


Questions
   * Sharing data with a requirement to ask for permission, does that make it open or not?
       * Data needs to be considered carefully as in many cases it's irresponsable to share data without restrictions. Data should not be modified. It should be considered case-by-case!
   *  How can we share data with sensitive information?
       * Consult with a librarian
       * Consider anonymizing or de-identifying your data
           * [https://arx.deidentifier.org/](https://arx.deidentifier.org/)
   * Can we revoke an open license:
       * [https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2022/05/11/q-can-you-revoke-a-creative-commons-license-a-no-er-sort-of-maybe/](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2022/05/11/q-can-you-revoke-a-creative-commons-license-a-no-er-sort-of-maybe/)
       * It's possible to close the open project and "republish" a closed version

**Any written insights/thoughts/comments to share**

### Self reflections

 (5 mins) [‚è∞ 95]

   * **Name / what kind of outputs you expect to come out from your project? Should you be considering open license for them?**
       * Shay Chavoshian/ Comprehensive reports, A set of practical guidelines to reduce falls
       * Arne/of course, I will be using open license because there is so much applications of ML that we can find from many sources.  The project expects collaboration from many disciplines and sectors of society,  to do disability studies and intersectionality requires patience and perseverance but, I believe we can still achieve positive outcomes.
       * Fanwang/ my research outputs will be models, codes as webservers. We will add open license to them.
       * Anemily / Educational material and absolutetly they are intended to be open
       * Kaitlyn / Educational materials/ tutorials / Jupyter notebooks with synthetic data. They will be open-source. I will include synthetic/simulated datasets, as I work with sensitive health data in my research. I will also have survey information / feedback, but this will remain private and I will instead share aggregated and anonymized data.  
       * Amy/ Educational and training materials with theoretical knowledge, code and possibly data. After today's workshop, I will definitely consider using an open license, as I want individuals to be able to use, modify and share the materials. I am unsure where to start, but I am excited to look into this and get an open license!
       * Ijeoma/Educational/Training materials - Thinking about making them open; will consider using an open license for documents and would like users to provide attribution but also modify and share the documents
       * Soorena / An event's report and revised training materials with EDIA approach, I should investigate and learn more about open licenses
       * Simplice/Education material provide by my projet will be open access for all.
       * Laura Camelo/ multilingual learning and informational material. I think open license would be great because it alows other people to have access to it :) 
       * Musanna Galib/ a software package to link qunatum mechanics to machine learning for materials science-openly available through github/ jupyter nook tutorial, will reach the scientific community to understand their needs
       * Ameer/ Pre-trained GCNN model for materials, datasets for materials, Jupyter notebook tutorial.
       * Adekola/My research output will involve information storage in a repository 
       * Ajitesh / My research outputs will be data, code and documentaion. Considering open licenses for the code and documentation would benefit collaboration with other researchers. As for the data, it is aggregated from closed resources so using an open license for it would require further investigation into the licenses used by our sources.
       * Clotilde Djuikem/Que les filles et femmes PANDC s'orientent vers les STEM/ Le projet va √™tre ouvert mais comme pour le moment je pr√©vois de faire uniquement interventions et les vid√©os qui vont √™tre sur Youtube. Mais dans le suite du projet je compte √©crire les approches pour la vulgarisation qui va √™tre open source.
       * Emilie / educational \& training material <- yes, survey data <- probably not everything, but some data could be shared
       * Elham / The biological signals of people with neurological disorders before and after suggested intervention. This dataset will be an open source dataset as I hope to facilitate researchers' work in this area of neurological pathologies. 
       * Renee/Jupyter Notebook tutorials and the code necessary for the tutorials. They will be open source as I hope they will be used and modified by future users to improve them or conduct further tutorials. I will also be collecting survey data to measure the effectiveness of my tutorials, which I don't anticipate being open source. 
       * Nathan/Needs Assesment report + Training materials in two separate iterations of the project. Qualitative interview data underlying the assesment will not be made open due to human ethics concerns but I am currently anticipating the assessment coding will be. For the report and the resulting training materials I anticipate using a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.  
       * Stacey/ The outputs from my project will be a survey and the data that comes from that.  That data will be used to create workshops.  My institution would not allow me to publish any of the data and the metadata would be in a conference paper, which would include its own license.  I do not believe that I would be able to make the results open myself, so I do not think I could apply an open license.  However, this has been useful for my other open projects that I do.
       * Vincent Comeau / I will be creating workshops for Indigenous researchers, which will be delivered in person. Perhaps I could make the documentation for these workshops available online. Not sure what kind of open license would apply in this case.
       * Moses/ Habitat models in the context of indigenous insights/ highly dependent on the indigenous people
       * Mona / providing workshops on how to access to high-performance computing and enhancing research skills to non-English-speaking international students. particularly marginalized and at-risk scholars for helping them integrate into Canadian academia, the materials will all be open-source and available to the public
       * Oluwatoyin Aladejebi/Educational materials used for training at the workshops as well reports on findings. I will make this open 
       * Nadia/ Educational \& Publications, All aspects could be licencened. I should consult with my mentor about data!!

## üñ•  Community Participation Guideline \& Code of Conduct!

Malvika (20 min)[‚è∞ 155]
   * Slides: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQBemDyyC8rP6DzsXiHK4QM70TeRdJL4gGYL4io\_J5uh7evt-27VLAcAhtraSyJ3tHH\_V30Zou1lQyj/pub?start=false\&loop=false\&delayms=3000](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQBemDyyC8rP6DzsXiHK4QM70TeRdJL4gGYL4io\_J5uh7evt-27VLAcAhtraSyJ3tHH\_V30Zou1lQyj/pub?start=false\&loop=false\&delayms=3000)

Notes:
       * A contribution document can be seen as an onboarding document for new people, they structure contributions by providing guidelines to new contributors.
       * No project is done in a void! You'll always have a community around your project, and you can make use of that to "fish" contributors and users.
       * 
       * 

Questions

       * How do you deal with compensation for the contribution? Some people may expect some form of compensation if they contribute
           * Contribution might look different for different people - we'll discuss attribution later in the training!
       * What is the difference between contribution guidelines and a code of conduct (if any)?
           * Code of conduct described the desired and expected behaviour for the whole community involved (users, collaborators and project leaders)
           * Contribution guidelines are very specific about *how* to contribute content and labour to your project (what are the steps? what's the language? should I open an issue? should I email the leaders?)
       * How to keep people engaged in contribution?
           * We'll have calls about community engagement down the road =D
       *
