# Open Seeds OLS-9


Welcome! This is the [ninth cohort of Open Seeds](https://openlifesci.org/ols-9) (OLS-9) program repository. 
This repository will be used for the issue tracker feature of GitHub. 
All the projects going through OLS-8 will use one issue to keep track of their progress during the program (see [projects and participants](https://openlifesci.org/ols-7/projects-participants/)).

## How to Work With Us

Each issue will provide details for a project currently going through OLS-7. 
Find out more about each project and how you can get involved in the individual issues.
