### Breakout room: Speaking and Writing preference
This will help us assign you to the breakout room with the format of your choice:
- **W** - written reflection-based exercise in the main room
- **S-En** - spoken discussion in English
- **S-Fr** - spoken discussion in French
- **S-Fr/En** - spoken discussion in French or English

**Where to indicate preference?** In your Zoom name  
You can edit your Zoom name directly (click on the three dots on the top right of your video) and add one W or S letters in front of your name.  
Please let us know in the chat your preference for the breakout room today - a co-host will edit your name to add one of these letters:  
If you are ok with both, please choose one for this week so that the hosts can assign you to a breakout room during the cohort call.

### Notes:
- Open research is not = good research! There's no judgment =D
- Open scholarship and research is a *movement* that focuses on making scientific knowledge and the production of the knowledge itself accessible and understandable to all levels of an inquiring society.
- Responsible practices = "as open as possible, as closed as necessary"
- It varies, and it's always a good idea to consult with a librarian!  
- Open science is more than just publication but rather making your work reproducible.

### Questions:
- Do you address CARE principles too?

# üñ• Open Data!

### Taj (15 min)[‚è∞ 45]

#### Presenter: Diana Pilvar
- Contact / social: diana.pilvar@ut.ee
- Slides on Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/13981241](https://zenodo.org/records/13981241)
- Cite this as: Pilvar, D. (2024, October 23). Open Data (FAIR Data Management). Zenodo. [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13981241](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13981241) (shared under CC-By 4.0)

#### Notes:
- To make your data open you apply a license > make it available > make it findable
- Not all data should be publicly available
- Open data != FAIR, but as FAIR as possible
- FAIR in practice
  - Findable - add a DOI, index your metadata, add keywords
  - Accessible - who can access your data, under which conditions?
  - Interoperable - save your data in a software independent format
  - Reusable - add a license and document your data (data creation and meaning)
- Data management has a life cycle, and it needs constant effort
- Open Data and FAIR are not the same but have the same goals
- It's a good idea to set aside about 5% of your budget to data management

#### Questions:
- Any tips on very large datasets? Some datasets in my field can be quite large (multiple terabytes)
- I have a question, if I found a dataset online, but the README and license are not clear. It is downloadable. Could I use it? Or should I contact the owners before I do anything to them? The data is stored in Zenodo with some metadata.

# üë• Open Science?!

### Taj explains and Malvika shares (15 min)[‚è∞ 60]

#### Instructions for the room
Discussion prompts for the room:
- Do you think research in your domain is open?
  - If yes, how is it open? Why do you call it open?
  - If you wouldn‚Äôt call it open, why not? Should we then call it ‚Äúclosed‚Äù research?
  - If applicable, include a comment on who is inside that closeted research and who is left out, who belongs and who doesn‚Äôt, who decides that?
  - Think of what group you belong to.
  - Do you think you have the power or information to change the dynamic?

#### Notes from breakout discussions
- **Breakout Room 1 - Spoken**
  - Names: Nooshin, Frank, Gracielle
  - Notes:
    - Data is not accessible, overall
    - Publications are also not accessible, and there are very high incurring fees.
    - Accessibility varies between countries - developing countries have different access to grants and funding, and so they have different access to research
    - We need to change the rules and regulations regarding accessing educational resources during economical embargo
    - There are huge grant funding opportunities for researchers in developed countries, however, it is very limited or none for researchers from developing countries. Moreover, independent researchers, scholars from less prestigious institutions, and those from underrepresented groups often feel like they don‚Äôt belong to open science due to systemic barriers that prevent full participation.

- **Breakout Room 5 - Written/Spoken**
  - Names: Arra, Louie, Chika
  - Notes:
    - Discussed the challenges of protecting participants while adhering to open science principles
    - How does open science and sharing of data impact participants

  ### Breakout Room 8 - Written/Spoken
**Names**  
Amy, Adeyemi, Anemily  

**Notes**  
- Changes in hardware and software versions can make results not reproducible.

### Breakout Room 12 - Written/Spoken
**Names**  
Ameer, Jane, Nishith  

**Notes**  
- Open access publications and open educational resources.  
- Jane and Nishith are in the field of law, while Ameer shared his experiences from material design sciences, especially pertaining to datasets and sharing in Huggingface.  
- Databases are good, but sometimes how to implement can be a barrier depending on the domain.  
- Open educational resources are a challenge, especially in the field of law, as the study, teaching, and learning of law is specific to the geographical area and the country in which law is being taught and learnt.  
- Huge fees paid for open access publication is a big challenge.  
- Challenges with accessing open educational resources by the Global South.  

### Breakout Room 13 - Written/Spoken
**Names**  
Jaimie, Linda, Moses  

**Notes**  
- Depends on the research domain. Some domains are very focused on open data, while others are less so.  
- Some data may be private/sensitive.  

### Breakout Room 16 - Written/Spoken
**Names**  
Oluwatoyin, Mona, Rebeca  

**Notes**  
- Our research domains are largely open.  
- However, some data can't be shared because of the sensitive nature of the data.  
- Universities supporting with partial or full payment of fees for open access publication is helping to encourage open research.   

### Any insights/thoughts/comments to share from your breakout room?
