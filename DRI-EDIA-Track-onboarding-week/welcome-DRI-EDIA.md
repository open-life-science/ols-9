## 🖥 About OLS and Open Seeds!

Malvika (15 min)[⏰ 25]

* Presenter: Malvika
   * Contact: malvika@we-are-ols.org / social: @malvikasharan
   * Slides: [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11UYMSEzGcwkvsTixPWp8nm6h3Xd0uCJ0Uuew82CO0RU/edit#slide=id.g2ffc1c481ff\_2\_0](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11UYMSEzGcwkvsTixPWp8nm6h3Xd0uCJ0Uuew82CO0RU/edit#slide=id.g2ffc1c481ff\_2\_0)
Notes:
       * Open Science is a collection of different practices, including open softwarem open hardware, open scientific knowledge and infrastructure, and open engagement with social actors.
       * Open Science applies to all stages of a project lifecycle - as well as all domains, sectors and kinds of projects
       * How to use open science to conduct our work responsibly?
       * OLS program will take ~16 weeks, with graduation in January, including many skill-up calls (which will be optional and recorded)
       * "Open leaders design, build, and empower their projects and communities for understanding, sharing and participation and inclusion" - From Mozilla Open Leaders
       * Participants can return to OLS as facilitators, mentors and expert consultants.
       * Slack is the easiest way to get to us, and we'll communicate by email as well.
       * Interpersonal skills will be nurtured and practiced in OLS in between the lines
       * Cohort calls will allow fellows to get understanding about specific concepts in Open Science, and will usually be related to a "homework" (a task that will help you progress on your project)
       * If you want a NASA badge (!!), let OLS team know and they will send your name to NASA by the time you graduate 🎉

**Questions from Group 1**
 
 * Mentoring groups can be checked here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e6wknptZED4VtTwn1YPSoBgB7vg1s\_BwQ3\_o3YhAhjY/edit?gid=1440757621#gid=1440757621](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e6wknptZED4VtTwn1YPSoBgB7vg1s\_BwQ3\_o3YhAhjY/edit?gid=1440757621#gid=1440757621)
* You're going to develop your project during the OLS program. You don't have to postpone the start of your project, but the program will help you shape it before launch. You can also always adapt your project on the go!
* DRI training will come for DRAC cohort before the end of the year. DRAC will contact Champions soon with dates. 

**Questions from Group 2**

* DRAC infrastructure training will happen later in the year; they will be separate sessions with specific topics on DRI resources
* OLS mentors is different from DRAC mentors; OLS mentors will be your accountability partners in the OLS training; the DRAC mentor will help you navigate institutional bureaucracy, connect you with institutional partners, etc.
* There are no requirements from OLS other than the final presentation; DRAC requires reports

## 👥 Breakout discussion

* What has been your best mentoring experience so far in your career? 
* What are some challenges you can think of in mentoring relationships in OLS? How do you think they can be addressed?
* What one advise would you give to anyone to make the most of a mentoring program?

    * Challenges: specificities of each project, deadlines and timeframe, when people talk past each other (interruptions), assumptions when doing collaboration and support
